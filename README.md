# CS121Projects
These are all of the projects that I did while taking Boise State CS121. All of the projects were coded in Java, and are ready to run when downloaded! Some code was done by professors at Boise State as part of templates, while the rest was done by me. The code should have this CLEARLY marked! Enjoy.
